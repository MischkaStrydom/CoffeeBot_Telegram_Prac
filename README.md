/start to start the bot.

CoffeeBot is a bot that will display a coffee menu with a few drinks and sizes (small,medium and large) and a user can place an order and the coffee/coffees will be delivered to you.

You can order drinks in multiple ways for example:
Just typing the drink you want to order and the bot will ask you what size you would want.
  
You can add a sentance with the drink of choice and the size.
You can add a sentance with just the drink of choice and the bot will ask you what size and you can enter a sentance saying what size you want.

You can add multiple drinks to your order and once you end the order the bot will display your order breakdown and total amount due. 
The bot will then ask you to enter an address to deliver the order and once the address is entered it will tell yu that the order will be delivered at the address and payment will be done on delivery.

If the bot encounters something unexpected it will tell you that it's not a valid drink and to please enter a drink on the menu.
